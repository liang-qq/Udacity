def entries_histogram(turnstile_weather):
    '''
    Before we perform any analysis, it might be useful to take a
    look at the data we're hoping to analyze. More specifically, let's 
    examine the hourly entries in our NYC subway data and determine what
    distribution the data follows. This data is stored in a dataframe
    called turnstile_weather under the ['ENTRIESn_hourly'] column.
    
    Let's plot two histograms on the same axes to show hourly
    entries when raining vs. when not raining. Here's an example on how
    to plot histograms with pandas and matplotlib:
    turnstile_weather['column_to_graph'].hist()
    
    Your histogram may look similar to bar graph in the instructor notes below.
    
    You can read a bit about using matplotlib and pandas to plot histograms here:
    http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html#histograms
    
    You can see the information contained within the turnstile weather data here:

    '''
    
    plt.figure()
    turnstile_weather['ENTRIESn_hourly'].hist() # your code here to plot a historgram for hourly entries when it is raining
    turnstile_weather['ENTRIESn_hourly'].hist() # your code here to plot a historgram for hourly entries when it is not raining

def mann_whitney_plus_means(turnstile_weather):
    '''
    This function will consume the turnstile_weather dataframe containing
    our final turnstile weather data. 
    
    You will want to take the means and run the Mann Whitney U-test on the 
    ENTRIESn_hourly column in the turnstile_weather dataframe.
    
    This function should return:
        1) the mean of entries with rain
        2) the mean of entries without rain
        3) the Mann-Whitney U-statistic and p-value comparing the number of entries
           with rain and the number of entries without rain
    
    You should feel free to use scipy's Mann-Whitney implementation, and you 
    might also find it useful to use numpy's mean function.

    The NYC turnstile data is stored in a pandas dataframe called weather_turnstile.
    Using the information stored in the dataframe, let's predict the ridership of
    the NYC subway using linear regression with gradient descent.
    
    You can download the complete turnstile weather dataframe here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv    
    
    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of 0.40 or better.
    You need to experiment using various input features contained in the dataframe. 
    We recommend that you don't use the EXITSn_hourly feature as an input to the 
    linear model because we cannot use it as a predictor: we cannot use exits 
    counts as a way to predict entry counts. 
    
    Note: Due to the memory and CPU limitation of our Amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subet (~15%) of the data contained in 
    turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv. You are encouraged to experiment with 
    this computer on your own computer, locally. 
    
    
    If you'd like to view a plot of your cost history, uncomment the call to 
    plot_cost_history below. The slowdown from plotting is significant, so if you 
    are timing out, the first thing to do is to comment out the plot command again.
    
    If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are 
    hitting the 30-second limit that's placed on running your program. Try using a 
    smaller number for num_iterations if that's the case.
    
    If you are using your own algorithm/models, see if you can optimize your code so 
    that it runs faster.
