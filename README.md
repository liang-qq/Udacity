# Udacity
My Udacity work for UD 617 Introduction to Hadoop and MapReduction

I finished project 1 and 2, however starting from project 3 to the final project the udacity coding quiz workspace changed without providing the raw dataset and coding interface.
So I forked other person's coding scripts in the folder of 'From Others' for learning purposes.  You could find those scripts here: https://github.com/PavelStibal/A0X36MOOC-Intro-to-Hadoop-and-MapReduce
